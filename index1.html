    Welcome to my site!

    <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="http:https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>.Going over everything from how the
      internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
      Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

    <ol>
      <li>HTML is cool</li>
      <li>CSS is cooler</li>
      <li>JS is the best<li>
    </ol>

    <h1> What do you need to create a website? </h1>

    <p>Not much!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
      <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
      <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
      <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>

      Follow my progress on github
